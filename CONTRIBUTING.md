## How to Write a Pull Request

To keep our codebase clean and reviews efficient, please follow these guidelines when opening a PR:

1. **Create a focused PR**
   - One feature, fix, or refactor per PR
   - Avoid combining unrelated changes

2. **Use a clear PR title**
   - Follow this format where possible:
     - `feat: short description`
     - `fix: short description`
     - `refactor: short description`

3. **Fill out the PR template**
   - Do not remove sections
   - Clearly describe what changed and why
   - Link related issues (e.g. `Closes #42`)

4. **Ensure code quality**
   - Run tests locally before opening the PR
   - Make sure all CI checks pass
   - Follow existing code and naming conventions

5. **Request reviews**
   - Assign at least **1 reviewer**
   - Address review comments before merging

6. **Keep PRs manageable**
   - Prefer small, reviewable PRs
   - Large changes should be broken into multiple PRs when possible

Thank you for helping keep our repositories consistent and easy to maintain 🚀
